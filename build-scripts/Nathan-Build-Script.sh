# DIRTY UNICORNS BUILD SCRIPT
# Build Dirty Unicorns with one easy script. You will need to have the repo synced and configured already, use this page to help you with that: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathanchance/Android-Tools/master/Building_AOSP.txt

# Necessary edits:
# You will need to manually edit some variables/sections based on your preferences (read the comments throughout the script to understand what is doing on)

# Usage:
# $ . du.sh <device> <sync|nosync> <clean|noclean> <log|nolog>

# Examples:
# $ . du.sh angler sync clean
# $ . du.sh hammerhead nosync noclean log

# HINT: You can add the folder this is in to your PATH variable so you can run it from anywhere like so:
# $ nano ~/.bashrc
# Add  export PATH=$PATH:<path_to_folder>  to the end of that file, then hit ctrl+X, Y, then Enter
# example: export PATH=$PATH:/home/<username>/scripts
# Restart your terminal

# Parameters:
# Parameter 1: Device you want to build (angler, hammerhead, bullhead, etc.)
# Parameter 2: Do you want to perform a repo sync before compilation?
# Parameter 3: Do you want to make clobber or make installclean? (go with clean if you are unsure)
DEVICE=$1
SYNC=$2
CLEAN=$3
LOG=$4

# Variables:
# SOURCEDIR: The directory that holds your DU repos (for example, /home/<username>/android/DU)
# OURDIR: The directory that holds the completed DU zip directly after compilation (automatically <sourcedirectory>/out/target/product/<device>, don't change this)
# DESTDIR: The directory that will hold your completed DU zip files for ease of access (for example, /home/<username>/completed_zips)
